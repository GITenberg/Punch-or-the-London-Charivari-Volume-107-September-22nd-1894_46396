<h2>IN PARIS OUT OF THE SEASON.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>With some Notes on a Detective Melodrama at the Ambigu.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">
Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;When I announced my intention of running over to
Paris for a few days, my friend <span class="smcap">Buzzard</span> looked at me with a stony
contempt. "To Paris?" he said, "at this time of year! Why, you must be
mad. What on earth are you going to do there?" I tried to explain to
<span class="smcap">Buzzard</span>, whose frigid superiority frightens me, that I liked Paris, that
I was going there <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="to loosen up">pour me dégourdir</i>; that it was just as possible to
breakfast at <span class="smcap">Ledoyen's</span> or <span class="smcap">Voisin's</span>, and to dine at <span class="smcap">Durand's</span> or <span class="smcap">Joseph's</span>
in September as at any other time; that a few theatres were still open;
that the Boulevards were there for the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="strollers">flâneur</i>; but I failed to
penetrate his scorn, even with the most idiomatic French at my command.
However, I determined that <span class="smcap">Buzzard</span>, like the weight of the elephant in
the problem, must be neglected; and here I am in the Rue de Rivoli with
another madman like unto myself. We take our <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="full coffee">café complet</i> in bed; we
wear beautiful French ties, made of <i>foulard</i>, with two vast ends
floating like banners in the Parisian breeze&mdash;in a word, we are
thoroughly enjoying ourselves in an entirely non-British
fashion&mdash;which I take, indeed, to be of the essence of a pleasant
holiday. What care we for the echoes of the Trades Union Congress; for
the windiest of <span class="smcap">Keir Hardie's</span>
blatancies; for the malignities of Mr.
<span class="smcap">Chamberlain</span>, or the failure of Lord
<span class="smcap">Rosebery's</span> <i>Ladas</i> at Doncaster? We
are in Paris, and the sight of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Dreadnaught">cuirassier</i> trotting past with his
great black <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="mane">crinière</i> waving behind, or of the lady bicyclists scudding
by in knickerbockers, excites us more than even the latest ravings of
the newest woman in London. <span class="smcap">Buzzard</span> be blowed! You may tell him I said
so.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">

</div>

<p>I want to let Mr. <span class="smcap">Conan Doyle</span> know that there is a great opening
for him here. If I may judge by the latest detective drama, the
ideas of the Parisian public with regard to the acumen and general
power of a detective are still very primitive. Yet <span class="smcap">Gaboriau</span> did
something in this line, and, in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vicomte de Bragelonne</i>, did not
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d'Artagnan</i> show himself on the occasion of a certain duel to be a
detective of unmatchable force? Still the fact remains that the
play-going Parisian public is easily satisfied in the matter of detectives.
Listen, if you doubt me, to a plain unvarnished account of
"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Belle Limonadière</i>," the "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Big new drama in five acts, eight scenes">Grand drame nouveau en cinq
actes, huit tableaux</i>," which is now running gloomily, but with
immense success, at the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ambigu</i>.</p>

<p><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Mazerolles</i>, a wealthy widow, is, in the first Act,
robbed and brutally murdered by her stepson, <i>Roland</i>, a dissipated
young man, who is incited to the commission of the crime by his
wicked mistress <i>Sabine</i>. <i>Vidocq</i>, the great representative of the new
school in detection (<i>circa</i> A.D. 1820), is away at the time, and in his
absence the investigation falls to his rival <i>Yvrier</i>, who belongs to the
old school. In the chamber of death <i>Yvrier</i> soon makes up his mind
that the guilty person is one <i>Henri Lebrun</i>, a faithful and gigantic
old soldier, much given to beating his breast with both fists and
talking at large about his services to his country, his immaculate
honesty and his domestic virtues. Suddenly <i>Vidocq</i> enters. He discovers
that the assassin has entered by a certain door because a cobweb
has been disturbed, he picks up a red flower dropped by the
assassin, he pours contempt on the crass stupidity of <i>Yvrier</i>&mdash;all
quite in the best Sherlock Holmes style. But nothing comes of it all.
Poor <i>Henri Lebrun</i>, still beating his breast with fists, is arrested, and
after a painful interview with his only daughter (whom he discovers
to have been the mistress of <i>George</i>, the son of <i>Madame Mazerolles</i>),
he becomes sublime, accuses himself quite unnecessarily of the murder
he had never committed, and is marched off to prison amid the
execrations of the populace, the triumph of the crass <i>Yvrier</i>, and the
loudly expressed determination of <i>Vidocq</i> to bring the guilty to
justice and save the life of the innocent <i>Lebrun</i>. Time passes.
<i>Lebrun</i>, overwhelmed by an entire absence of proofs, is tried and
condemned to death. It is the morning appointed for his execution.
The curtain rises in the upper floor of a restaurant commanding an
extensive view of the guillotine. The sight-seers troop in. First of
all comes <i>Roland</i>, the murderer, disguised in black as a wicked
Marquis, and accompanied by the infamous <i>Sabine</i>. <i>Hélène Lebrun</i>,
the daughter of the condemned man, also troops in to slow music in
black. There is a commotion at the door, and the obsequious innkeeper
backs on to the stage ushering in <i>Milord Sir John Stilton</i> and
his son "<i>Shames</i>." <i>Sir John</i> is dressed in an enormous green
swallow-tailed coat with brass buttons, a striped yellow waistcoat, a
pair of yellow knickerbockers, and stockings brilliantly striped with
red and black. On his head he wears a low-crowned hat. In one
hand he carries an umbrella, while a telescope dangles from his
Shoulders by a strap. In short, he is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="could not be more English">tout-ce-qu'il-y-a de plus
Anglais</i>. His son <i>Shames</i> is even more aggressively British. <i>Sir
John</i> orders lunch: "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="give me a steak">vous donner moa bifteck</i>" is the obvious
formula. <i>Shames</i> concurs with a "Yehs, Pappah," which provokes
roars of laughter. But stay, what is this? <i>Sir John</i> takes <i>Shames</i>
aside: they talk in beautiful French. Can it be? Yes, by Heaven,
it is the great <i>Vidocq</i> with his faithful <i>Coco-Latour</i>! We breathe
again, for now we know that the innocent man is safe. The procession,
however, approaches. The condemned man speaks from
below to his daughter in the balcony. He declares his innocence.
Now good <i>Vidocq</i>, to the rescue. Display all your arts, convict the
guilty, disguised Marquis, and save the estimable <i>Lebrun</i>! But
<i>Vidocq</i> looks on impassive, a dull thud is heard and the head of the
innocent rolls into the basket. Immediately afterwards <i>Yvrier</i>
staggers in. Too late, he says, he has been convinced of <i>Lebrun's</i>
innocence. At the last moment <i>Lebrun</i> looked at him with eyes in
which there was no trace of guilt. That last look did it, and now
<i>Yvrier</i> in a passion of repentance offers himself to help <i>Vidocq</i>, even
in the most subordinate capacity, to track down the guilty, and to
remove the stain from <i>Lebrun's</i> name. I pass over the padding,
during which <i>Vidocq</i> appears, for no earthly reason, in numerous disguises,
and come to the last scene. <i>Roland</i> has all but killed <i>George
Mazerolles</i> in a duel, he has murdered <i>Sabine</i>, who, before dying,
rounds on him, and he is now, by a strange conjunction of circumstances,
in the very room in which he murdered <i>Madame Mazerolles</i>.
Thither also comes everybody else. <i>Vidocq</i>, who is tracking <i>Roland</i>,
discovers, through a paper belonging to the late <i>Madame Mazerolles</i>,
that <i>Roland</i>, her murderer, was her son, not her step-son, and that he,
<i>Vidocq</i>, is the father of <i>Roland</i>. In his youth <i>Vidocq</i> had been a soldier.
Somewhere he had met <i>Madame Mazerolles</i>. "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="We loved between two battles, between two victories">Nous nous sommes
aimés entre deux batailles, entre deux victoires</i>," and <i>Roland</i> was the
fruit of their love. Horror of horrors! What is he to do? First he
tells <i>Roland</i> that he killed, not his step-mother, but his mother. At
this awful intelligence, <i>Roland</i> faints in an armchair for precisely ten
seconds. Recovering himself, he is fain to escape. <i>Vidocq</i>, all his
fatherly instincts aroused, says he shall. The weak <i>Yvrier</i> consents,
when suddenly, from behind a curtain, appears <i>Hélène Lebrun</i> in
black. The murderer of her father must not escape, she declares,
whereupon the great detective, vowing that his son shall never be
food for the guillotine, shoots him dead with a toy pistol in the
region of the left waistcoat pocket. Tableau! Curtain!</p>

<p>There, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, you have the French <i>Sherlock</i> on the stage.
A wonderful man, is he not?</p>

<h2>THANKS TO THE "BYSTANDER."</h2>

<p>I am glad to see the "<span class="smcap">Bystander</span>" in the <i>Graphic</i> has recently
uttered a startled protest against the fashion, now somewhat overdone,
and occasionally objectionably done, of lady-begging for
charitable purposes in the London streets. On the sudden apparition
of one of these merry half-sisters of charity (were not the Pecksniffian
daughters Charity and Merry?) Mr. <span class="smcap">Ashby Sterry</span> became well-nigh
hysterrycal, and his generosity being temporarily paralysed,
he fled, with pockets tightly buttoned. For the moment he was no
longer the "<span class="smcap">Bystander</span>," whose motto is that of <i>Captain Cuttle</i>,
"Stand by," but, as though he had heard the command to "Stand
and deliver," our sturdy "<span class="smcap">Bystander</span>" became a fugitive from
before the face of the giddy charity girl, and thus at one "go" saved
his halfpence and his honour. For his reputation would have suffered
had he impolitely rebuffed his fair unfair assailant. He did well to
flee, he did still better to write and publicly complain. We trust that
this process adopted by <i>the</i> Sterry O'Type (a fine old Irish title by the
way) may have its due influence, and that the abuse, which has
become thus Sterry O'Typed, of a fashion good in itself and its origin,
may soon cease to exist. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Meanwhile">En attendant</i>, <i>Mr. Punch</i> is pleased to
know that the "<span class="smcap">Bystander</span>" is still running on, and not likely to
come to a standstill.

<h2>A ST. LEGER COINCIDENCE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;Will you afford
me a small portion of your space to put on record once and for ever a
most extraordinary coincidence? Last Wednesday afternoon I was taking a
country walk, when all at once my eye was suddenly caught by a throstle.
At the same time I accidentally looked at my watch. It had stopped at
12.10. When I got home I mentioned both of these circumstances to my
wife.</p>

<p>Later in the evening I bought an evening paper, and was amazed to find
that the St. Leger had been won by <i>Throstle</i> (the bird I had seen),
which had started at 50 to 1 (the exact minute at which my watch had
stopped)! Could the force of coincidence farther go? The Society
of Psychical Research and Mr. <span class="smcap">Stead</span>
are welcome to this incident. The only thing which troubles me at all is
that the evidence (other than my own) is a little slender. My wife is
deaf, and never heard what I told her. The bird has flown. My watch is
going again.</p>

<p>I inclose my card, and am,</p>

<p class="i2">Yours <span class="smcap">Stead-y</span> to a degree,</p>

<p class="i4 smcap">One who Won Nothing on the Race.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>A Story in Scenes.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">PART XII.&mdash;DIGNITY UNDER DIFFICULTIES.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene XXI.</span>&mdash;<i>The Housekeeper's Room at Wyvern</i>; Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pomfret</span>,
<i>the Housekeeper, in a black silk gown and her smartest cap, is
seated in a winged arm-chair by the fire, discussing domestic
politics with</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Culverin's</span> <i>maid</i>, Miss <span class="smcap">Stickler</span>. <i>The Chef</i>,
<span class="smcap">M. Ridevos</span>, <i>is resting on the sofa, in languid converse with</i> Mlle.
<span class="smcap">Chiffon</span>, Miss <span class="smcap">Spelwane's</span> <i>maid</i>; <span class="smcap">Pilliner's</span> <i>man</i>, <span class="smcap">Louch</span>,
<i>watches</i> <span class="smcap">Steptoe</span>, Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert's</span> <i>valet, with admiring envy, as he
makes himself agreeable to</i> Miss <span class="smcap">Phillipson</span>, <i>who is in demi-toilette,
as are all the other ladies' maids present</i>.</p>

<p><i>Miss Stickler (in an impressive undertone).</i> All I <i>do</i> say, Mrs.
<span class="smcap">Pomfret</span>, ma'am, is this: if that girl <span class="smcap">Louisa</span> marches into the pew
to-morrow, as she did <i>last</i> Sunday, before the second laundry maid&mdash;and
her only under-scullery maid&mdash;such presumptiousness should be
put a stop to in future!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pomfret (wheezily).</i> Depend upon it, my dear, it's her
ignorance; but I shall most certainly speak about it. Girls must be
taught that ranks was made to be respected, and the precedency into that
pew has come down from time immemoriable, and is not to be set aside by
such as her while <i>I</i>'m 'ousekeeper here.</p>

<p><i>Mlle. Chiffon</i> (<i>in French, to</i> <span class="smcap">M. Ridevos</span>). You have the air fatigued,
my poor friend! Oh, there&mdash;but fatigued!</p>

<p><i>M. Ridevos.</i> Broken, Mademoiselle, absolutely broken. But what will
you? This night I surpass myself. I achieve a masterpiece&mdash;a
sublime pyramid of quails with a sauce that will become classic. I pay
now the penalty of a veritable crisis of nerves. It is of my temperament
as artist.</p>

<p><i>Mlle. Chiffon.</i> And me, my poor friend, how I have suffered from the
cookery of these others&mdash;I who have the stomach so feeble, so
fastidious! Figure to yourself an existence upon the villainous curry,
the abominable "Iahristue," beloved by these barbarians, but which
succeed with me not

at all&mdash;oh, but not at all! Since I am here&mdash;ah, the difference! I
digest as of old&mdash;I am gay. But next week to return with Mademoiselle
to the curry, my poor friend, what regrets!</p>

<p><i>M. Rid.</i> For me, dear Mademoiselle, for me the regrets&mdash;to hear
no more the conversation, so spiritual, so sympathetic, of a fellow-countrywoman.
For remark that here they are stupid&mdash;they comprehend
not. And the old ones they roll at me the eyes to make
terror. Behold this Gorgon who approaches. She adores me, my
word of honour, this ruin!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[Miss <span class="smcap">Stickler</span> <i>comes up to the sofa smiling in happy unconsciousness</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Miss Stick, (graciously).</i> So you've felt equal to joining us for once,
Mossoo! We feel it a very 'igh compliment, I can assure you.
We've really been feeling quite 'urt at the way you keep to yourself&mdash;you
might be a regular 'ermit for all <i>we</i> see of you!</p>

<p><i>M. Rid.</i> For invent, dear Mees, for create, ze arteeste must live ze
solitaire as of rule. To-night&mdash;no! I emairge, as you see, to
res-tore myself viz your smile.</p>

<p><i>Miss Stick, (flattered).</i> Well, I've always said, Mossoo, and
I always <i>will</i> say, that for polite 'abits and pretty speeches, give <i>me</i>
a Frenchman!</p>

<p><i>M. Rid. (alarmed).</i> For me it is too moch 'appiness. For anozzer,
ah!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He kisses his fingers with ineffable grace.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Phillipson</i> (<i>advancing to meet</i> Miss <span class="smcap">Dolman</span>, <i>who has just entered</i>).
Why, I'd no idea I should meet <i>you</i> here, <span class="smcap">Sarah</span>! And how have
you been getting on, dear? Still with&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Miss Dolman (checking her with a look).</i> Her grace? No, we
parted some time ago. I'm with Lady <span class="smcap">Rhoda Cokayne</span> at present.
(<i>In an undertone, as she takes her aside.</i>) You needn't say anything
here of your having known me at Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dickenson's</span>. I couldn't
afford to have it get about in the circle I'm in that I'd ever lived
with any but the nobility. I'm sure you see what I mean. Of
course I don't mind your saying we've <i>met</i>.</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> Oh, I <i>quite</i> understand. I'll say nothing. I'm obliged to
be careful myself, being maid to Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie Mull</span>.</p>

<p><i>Miss Dolm.</i> My <i>dear</i> <span class="smcap">Emma</span>! It <i>is</i> nice seeing you again&mdash;such
<i>friends</i> as we used to be!</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> At her Grace's? I'm afraid you're thinking of somebody
else. (<i>She crosses to</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pomfret</span>.) Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pomfret</span>, what's
become of the gentleman I travelled down with&mdash;the horse doctor?
I do hope he means to come in; he would amuse <i>you</i>, Mr. <span class="smcap">Steptoe</span>.
I never heard anybody go on like him; he <i>did</i> make me laugh so!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pomfr.</i> I really can't say <i>where</i> he is, my dear. I sent up
word to let him know he was welcome here whenever he pleased;
but perhaps he's feeling a little shy about coming down.</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> Oh, I don't think he suffers much from <i>that</i>. (<i>As the door
opens.</i>) Ah, <i>there</i> he is!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pomfr.</i> (<i>rising, with dignity, to receive</i> <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>, <i>who
enters in obvious embarrassment</i>). Come in, Sir. I'm glad to see you've
found your way down at last. Let me see, I haven't the advantage of
knowing your&mdash;Mr. <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>, <i>to</i> be sure! Well, Mr. <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>,
we're very pleased to see you. I hope you'll make yourself quite at
home. Her ladyship gave particular directions that we was to look after
you&mdash;<i>most</i> particular she was!</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> You are very good, Ma'am. I am obliged to Lady <span class="smcap">Culverin</span>
for her (<i>with a gulp</i>) condescension.
But I shall not trespass more than a short time upon your hospitality.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pomfr.</i> Don't speak of it as trespassing, Sir. It's not often we
have a gentleman of your profession as a visitor, but you are none the
less welcome. Now I'd better introduce you all round, and then you won't
feel yourself a stranger. Miss <span class="smcap">Phillipson</span> you <i>have</i> met, I know.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>She introduces him to the
others in turn</i>; <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>
<i>bows helplessly</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Steptoe (with urbanity).</i> Your fame, Sir, has preceded you. And you'll
find us a very friendly and congenial little circle on a better
acquaintance&mdash;if this is your first experience of this particular
form of society?</p>

<p><i>Und. (to himself).</i> I mustn't be stiff, I'll put them at their ease.
(<i>Aloud.</i>) Why, I must admit, Mr. <span class="smcap">Steptoe</span>, that I have never before
had the privilege of entering the&mdash;(<i>with an ingratiating smile all
round him</i>) the "Pugs' Parlour," as I understand you call this
very charming room.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>The company draw themselves up and cough in disapprobation.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Stept. (very stiffly).</i> Pardon <i>me</i>, Sir, you have been totally misinformed.
Such an expression is not current <i>here</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pomfr. (more stiffly still).</i> It is never alluded to in <i>my</i>
presence except as the 'Ousekeeper's Room, which is the right and
proper name for it. There may be some other term for it in the
Servants' 'All for anything <i>I</i> know to the contrary&mdash;but if you'll
excuse me for saying so, Mr. <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>, we'd prefer for it not to
be repeated in <i>our</i> presence.</p>

<p><i>Und. (confusedly).</i> I&mdash;I beg ten thousand pardons. (<i>To himself.</i>)
To be pulled up like this for trying to be genial&mdash;it's really <i>too
humiliating</i>!</p>

<p><i>Stept. (relaxing).</i> Well, well, Sir; we must make some allowances
for a neophyte. You'll know better another time, <i>I</i> daresay. Miss
<span class="smcap">Phillipson</span> here has been giving you a very favourable character as
a highly agreeable rattle, Mr. <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>. I hope we may
be favoured with a specimen of your social talents later on. We're
always grateful here for anything in that way&mdash;such as a recitation
now, or a comic song, or a yumorous imitation&mdash;anything, in short,
calculated to promote the general harmony and festivity will be
appreciated.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span></p>

<p><i>Miss (Stick acidly).</i> Provided it is free from any helement of
coarseness, which we do <i>not</i> encourage&mdash;far from it!</p>

<p><i>Und. (suppressing his irritation).</i> You need be under no alarm,
Madam. I do not propose to attempt a performance of <i>any</i> kind.</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> Don't be so solemn, Mr. <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>! I'm sure you can
be as comical as any playactor when you choose!</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> I really don't know how I can have given you that impression.
If you expect me to treat my lyre like a <i>horse-collar</i>, and grin
through it, I'm afraid I am unable to gratify you.</p>

<p><i>Stept. (at sea).</i> Capital, Sir, the professional allusion very neat.
You'll come out presently, <i>I</i> can see, when supper's on the table.
Can't expect you to rattle till you've something <i>inside</i> of you, can we?</p>

<p><i>Miss Stick.</i> Reelly, Mr. <span class="smcap">Steptoe</span>, I <i>am</i> surprised at such commonness
from <i>you</i>!</p>

<p><i>Stept.</i> Now you're too severe, Miss <span class="smcap">Stickler</span>, you are indeed. An
innocent little Judy Mow like that!</p>

<p><i>Tredwell (outside).</i> Don't answer <i>me</i>, Sir. Ham I butler 'ere, or
ham I <i>not</i>? I've a precious good mind to report you for such a
hignorant blunder.... I don't want to hear another word about the
gentleman's cloes&mdash;you'd no hearthly business for to do such a thing
at all! (<i>He enters and flings himself down on a chair.</i>) That <span class="smcap">Thomas</span>
is beyond everything&mdash;stoopid <i>hass</i> as he is!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pomfr. (concerned).</i> La, Mr. <span class="smcap">Tredwell</span>, you <i>do</i> seem put
out! Whatever have <span class="smcap">Thomas</span> been doing <i>now</i>?</p>

<p><i>Und. (to himself).</i> It's really very good of him to take it to heart
like this! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Pray don't let it distress you; it's of no
consequence, none at all!</p>

<p><i>Tred. (glaring).</i> I'm the best judge of that, Mr. <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>, Sir&mdash;if
you'll allow <i>me</i>; <i>I</i> don't call my porogatives of no consequence,
whatever <i>you</i> may! And that feller <span class="smcap">Thomas</span>, Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pomfret</span>,
actially 'ad the hordacity, without consulting me previous, to go and
'and a note to one of our gentlemen at the hupstairs table, all about
some hassinine mistake he'd made with his cloes! What call had
he to take it upon himself? I feel puffecly disgraced that such a
thing should have occurred under my authority!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>The</i> Steward's Room Boy <i>has entered with a dish, and listens
with secret anxiety on his own account</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Und.</i> I assure you there is no harm done. The gentleman is
wearing my evening clothes&mdash;but he's going to return them&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>The conclusion of the sentence is drowned in a roar of laughter
from the majority.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Tred. (gasping).</i> Hevenin' cloes! <i>Your</i> hevenin'&mdash;&mdash; P'raps you'll
'ave the goodness to explain yourself, Sir!</p>

<p><i>Stept.</i> No, no, <span class="smcap">Tredwell</span>, my dear fellah, you don't understand
our friend here&mdash;he's a bit of a wag, don't you see? He's only
trying to pull your leg, that's all: and, Gad, he did it too! But
you mustn't take liberties with <i>this</i> gentleman, Mr. <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>,
he's an important personage <i>here</i>, I can tell you!</p>

<p><i>Und. (earnestly).</i> But I never meant&mdash;if you'll only let me
explain&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>The</i> Boy <i>has come behind him, and administers a surreptitious
kick, which</i> <span class="smcap">Undershell</span> <i>rightly construes as a hint to hold
his tongue.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Tred. (in solemn offence).</i> I'm accustomed, Mr. <span class="smcap">Hundershell</span>, to
be treated in this room with respect and deference&mdash;especially by
them as come here in the capacity of Guests. <i>From</i> such I regard
any attempt to pull my leg as in hindifferent taste&mdash;to say the least
of it. I wish to 'ave no more words on the subjick, which is a painful
one, and had better be dropped, for the sake of all parties.
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pomfret</span>, I see supper is on the table, so, by your leave, we
had better set down to it.</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>). Never mind <i>him</i>, pompous old thing!
It <i>was</i> awfully cheeky of you, though. You can sit next <i>me</i> if
you like.</p>

<p><i>Und. (to himself, as he avails himself of this permission).</i> I shall
only make things worse if I explain now. But, oh, great Heavens,
<i>what</i> a position for a Poet.</p>

<h2>NEW LAMPS FOR OLD.</h2>

<p>Art was once defined as "the creation of new forms of beauty."
Our juvenile geniuses have altered all that. "The New Art" is
better defined as "the creation of novel forms of ugliness." Its
inspiration is Corruption, its auxiliaries are the two hideous imps,
Scratch and Smudge. Old Art, with its bosh about beauty, its rot
about romance, its fudge about finish, its twaddle about taste, will
be good enough to take a back seat. Apollo the Inspirer must give
way to the sooty imp and incubus, New Scratch!&mdash;</p>

<h2>THAT ADVANCED WOMAN!</h2>

<p class="center">(<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="A Symposium in Fashion.">A Symposium à la Mode.</i>)</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Author of
"A Saddis Aster"
confesses.</div>

<p>I am much flattered by your kind invitation
to discuss the Advanced Woman, but
an initial difficulty suggests itself to me.
Can one discuss the Advanced Woman if this Advanced Woman herself
is non-existent? I am aware, of course, that
she has stridden large of late in the pages of feminine
fiction, but is she not as extinct (before she
has ever existed) as her <span class="smcap">Dodo</span> title? Let me make
my own confession. I have used, if I did not
invent, the A. W. I have secured a remunerative
public. Once on a time I wrote of life as I found
it. I used my eyes and ears, and endeavoured to
let the world have the result in the old-fashioned,
wholesome story. It was a dreary failure. The
critics commended my style, and the public let me
severely alone. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="We changed all that.">Nous avons changé tout cela.</i> A
theatrical manager who finds his musical piece
begin to drag, saves the situation by a New
Edition&mdash;in other words, by two new songs and
some fresh dances. In a similar way I secured a
reputation by dragging in (at times by her very
heel) the Advanced Woman. True that she resembles no one in
actual existence, true, indeed, that she is outrageously and offensively
improbable, but the public were not happy till they got her. They're
happy now. So am I.</p>

<img src="images/142b.png"
alt="" /></a>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Mrs. Shriek Shriekon
speaks out.</div>

<p>I should have thought that <i>my</i> views on
the Advanced Woman were sufficiently well
known; but, since you ask my opinion, I may
say at once that I lose no opportunity of inveighing against this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="end-of-century abomination">fin-de-siècle</i>
abomination. Once on a time it was not thought unbecoming
for a woman to be modest and retiring. She knew her
sphere, and, queen in her own selected world, she did not aspire to a
sovereignty which naturally belonged to others. If they were alive
to-day (and, after all, some of them are), our grandmothers would
hardly know their <span class="smcap">Grand</span> children&mdash;the Heavenly Twins. I am glad
that I am permitted to keep burning the sacred lamp of the Old
Womanhood. Indeed, it looks as if the jeers which a thoughtless
world has hitherto reserved for the Old Maid were being transferred
to the Old Woman. Yet to those who have never yielded to the spell
of the latter-day notions, there is only dismay in the spectacle of the
Advanced Woman sweeping triumphantly on, with her mind full of
sex-problems she has not brains enough to understand, and her
breath stained with the trace of cigarettes she does not care to
conceal. Wholesomeness dies at being dubbed old-fashioned;
Modesty does not survive the disgrace of not being up to date. It's
a bad world, my masters, and I'm never tired of saying so.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ann U. Woman
dreams
of the Future.</div>

<p>The fact that you have invited my opinion
with full knowledge of what I shall say, emboldens
me to speak out. Man's day (which,
like every dog, he has had) draws to an end. For centuries he has
had Woman at his mercy. What she is to-day, that he has made
her. And what is she? His Doll, his Slave, his "Old Woman."
But Man made one fatal mistake. In a weak moment he consented
to allow Woman to earn her own living. From that moment our
ultimate triumph was assured. Now we know our strength. Told
of old that we were brainless, we now become Senior Wranglers.
Condemned aforetime to inactivity, we now realise that in life's
struggle there are no prizes we are not competent to secure, though,
of course, we are not always permitted. We have precipitated ourselves
out of a yellow miasma of stagnant sloth into an emancipated,
and advanced day. The Advanced Woman has come to stay&mdash;but
not with any husband. She will be as free as the air, as strong as
the eagle. I must stop, as to do any more fine writing would be to
anticipate my next novel. Be sure to get it. It will be called&mdash;&mdash;

<h2>"TRIPPING MERRILY."</h2>

<p>That holiday cruise on board the good steamship <i>Cannie Donia</i>!
Did I dream it? or was it a reality? "Are there wisions about?"
It seems like yesterday or like years ago, and I know it was neither.
"Old <span class="smcap">Kaspar's</span>,"&mdash;or let us say middle-aged <span class="smcap">Kaspar's</span>,&mdash;"work was
done" <i>pro tem.</i>, and he could not neglect so great an opportunity, nor
refuse so inviting an invitation as that sent him by Sir <span class="smcap">Charles
Cheerie</span>, the Chairman, to come aboard for the trial trip of the
G.S.S. <i>Cannie Donia</i>. So I, middle-aged <span class="smcap">Kaspar</span>, work done as
aforesaid, did then and thereby become <span class="smcap">Tommy</span> the Tripper, and,
as such, went aboard the gallant SS. abovementioned, all-to-the-contrary,
nevertheless, and notwithstanding.</p>

<p>And what a goodly company!</p>

<p>Sir <span class="smcap">Charles</span> and Lady <span class="smcap">Cheerie</span>, perfect host and hostess in
themselves. Here too was our <span class="smcap">Toby</span>, M.P., waggish as ever. "I
am not down on the official list of guests as '<span class="smcap">Tobias</span>,'" quoth he. "And
why?" I gave it up. "Because," says he, answering his own conundrum, "I
am a free and independent scribe, and there is nothing <i>to bias</i> me.
Aha!" The sea air agrees with <span class="smcap">Toby</span>, M.P. "And where <i>would</i> the Member
for Barkshire be," he asks, propounding as it were another and a better
puzzle, "but aboard a bonnie barque? My bark," he continues gaily, "may
be worse than my bite, but&mdash;&mdash;" Here the bugle-call to
breakfast sounds, and from ocular evidence I can roundly assert that
whatever his bark may be, I will back his bite&mdash;and this without
backbiting, of which, as I trust, neither of us is capable&mdash;against
that of any two of his own size and weight. Yet <span class="smcap">Toby</span> <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="while eating">en mangeant</i> is
not the dog in a manger, no, not by any means! With one eye to the main
chance, and another to the corresponding comfort of his co-breakfasters,
so pursueth he his steadfast course, as indeed do we all, to the
astonishment of most of us, through the shoals of toast and butter; over
the shallows of eggs; safely through the Straits of Kipper and Kurrie;
with a pleasant time in Hot Tea Bay; then through a Choppy sea, between
the dangerous rocks of Brawn and Bacon; into the calm Marmaladean Sea,
where we ride at anchor and all is well.</p>

<p>After breakfast, the cigar, or
pipe, with conversational accompaniment,
what time we pace
the quarter-deck. Prognostications
as to probable weather are
"taken and offered" by nautically-attired
guests, who, in a general way, may be supposed from
their seagoing costume "to know the ropes." Here is the ever
amiable and truly gallant Sir <span class="smcap">Peter Plural</span>, looking every inch the
ideal yachtsman, as honorary member of the Upper House of Cowes
and Ryde Piers. Wonderful man Sir <span class="smcap">Peter!</span> knows everybody, is
liked by everybody; has been yachting and sailing and voyaging
for any number of years; knows even the smallest waves by sight,
and, if asked, could probably tell you their names! One day he will
publish his reminiscences!</p>

<p>We anchor off Queenstown. The estimable, jovial <span class="smcap">Valentine
Vulcan</span>, M.P., from the North, must ashore to purchase some trifling
knickknacks by way of mementoes of the visit. Instead of "knickknacks"
he lays in a stock of "knock-knocks," yclept "shillelaghs,"
which are served out to him by a delicately pale beauty of
Erin, dark-haired, slim waisted, and as elegant as might be any
natty girl from County Trim. She shows us some dozen shillelaghs
with hard, murderous-looking, bulbous knobs.</p>

<p>"Phew!" whistles <span class="smcap">Valentine Vulcan</span>, M.P., weighing one of
these dainty sticks in his hand. "You might get rather a nasty
crack from this." I agree with him, and the sad daughter of Erin
regards us sadly and sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Maybe," I think to myself, "she has lost a friend or a lover in one
of these confounded <span class="smcap">O'Capulet</span> and <span class="smcap">O'Montague</span> rows. Poor girl!"
And I eye her with a look wherein admiration is tempered with pity.
It occurs to me that I will say something appropriate, just to show
her how I, a stranger and a Saxon, feel for her. It may lead her to
express her hearty detestation of these faction-fights, and of these
deadly fracas with the armed constabulary. So I say, with a touch
of deep indignation in my tone, "It's a shame," say I, "that such
things as these"&mdash;and I nod frowningly at the shillelaghs, which
<span class="smcap">Vulcan</span>, M.P., is twirling meditatively, one in each hand, as if right
and left were about to fight it out&mdash;"it's a shame that such things
as these should be permitted!" The pale, sad, beautiful daughter of
Erin, regards me mournfully, and then, in a tone expressive of
astonishment blended with firm remonstrance, she asks,&mdash;</p>

<p>"An' what <i>would</i> the poor Boys use, an' they not allowed fire-arms?"</p>

<p>That was all. No smile is on the lips of Erin's pale daughter. She is
apparently in earnest, though both <span class="smcap">Vulcan</span> and myself, talking it over
subsequently, unite in opinion that, perhaps, she had been availing
herself of this rare and unique opportunity of "getting at" the Saxon.</p>

<p>So she went on recommending sticks and photographs, and did a good bit
of business with our generous <span class="smcap">Vulcan</span>, M.P., who returned, laden with
gifts for various fellow-guests aboard the good SS. <i>Cannie Donia</i>.</p>

<p>What amusing nights and delightful days! The ladies&mdash;bless
'em!&mdash;all charming, and very Barkisses in their perpetual
"willingness" to do anything and everything that might give pleasure and
afford amusement. Two fairy-gifted maidens entertain us mightily with a
capital dramatic sketch of their own composition; others follow suit,
playing the piano; and a <i>sestette</i> perform, without previous rehearsal,
glees, madrigals, part-songs, and choruses to popular plantation
melodies, under the leadership of that masterly musician <span class="smcap">Tom Tolderol</span>,
whose only regret is that he has not been able to bring on board with
him his sixteen-horse-power-fifty-stopped-sixteen-pedal organ (designed
and made by the eminent firm of <span class="smcap">Bellows, Blower &amp; Co.</span>, at a cost of
some few thousand pounds), though, as he explains to us, he would have
done so, had this musical mammoth been only compressible within the
limits of an ordinary carpet bag.</p>

<p>However, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à propos</i> of organs, we have with us a representative of one
of the greatest organs&mdash;of the Press&mdash;full of wise saws and
modern instances; as jolly as a sandboy, or rather as a schoolboy out
for a holiday. A sailor every inch of him, and this is saying a
great deal, as he must be over six feet, and broad in proportion.</p>

<p>Appropriate, too, as aboard "the craft," is the presence of the
Great Grand Secretary, Mr. <span class="smcap">Benjamin Boaz</span>, A.M., P.G.M., &amp;c., &amp;c.,
and the still Greater, Grander Something Else, P.P.M., &amp;c., Sir
<span class="smcap">Jonathan Jachin</span>, mysterious officers, <i>Arcades ambo</i>, of the Secret
Rites of Masonry, fall of nods, winks, becks, wreathed smiles, signs,
secrets, fun, frolic, and tales galore.</p>

<p>Ah! the happy days! And the happy evenings! What excellent
"toasts" and "returnings of thanks" by my Lord <span class="smcap">Affidavit</span>, by Sir
<span class="smcap">Poseidon À Vinklo</span> (President of the Anchorite Court), by <span class="smcap">Andrew
McJason</span> (senior of the Argonautic Firm that built the good ship
<i>Cannie Donia</i>), and the sprightliest speech of all by Sir <span class="smcap">Charles
Cheerie</span>!</p>

<p>Round to Falmouth, up the Fal, "with our Fal, lal, la," as singeth
our brilliant <i>sestette</i> to piano, or, to quote Sir <span class="smcap">Jonathan</span>, "our P.
an' O." accompaniment.</p>

<p>Then S'uth'ards! Then.... But "here break we off."</p>

<p>Thus do I briefly make some record of a "trial trip"; and may no
trip that any of us may make, whether involving a trial or not, have
worse results than has this, of which, beginning and finishing happily
and gloriously as it has done&mdash;and such be the <i>Cannie Donia's</i> fate
evermore&mdash;I am privileged to write this slight record, and proud to
account myself henceforth as</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
